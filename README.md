Surgical Action Triplet Post Challenge Phase
Challenge Background
This project is inspired by the CholecTriplet 2022 Challenge and aims to contribute to the advancement of fine-grained surgical activity modeling in computer-assisted surgery.
For further details, refer to the official CholecTriplet GitHub repository.

Formalizing surgical activities as triplets of the used instruments, actions performed, and target anatomies acted upon provides a better understanding of surgical workflows. Automatic recognition of these triplet activities directly from surgical videos has the potential to revolutionize intra-operative decision support systems, enhancing safety and efficiency in the operating room (OR).
